# Udacity-full-stack-capstone-project

This project allow students to apply the skills learnt in this program.



### Aims:
1. Create data models representing `Movies`, `Actors` in `models.py`.  
2. use `auth.py` to verify permissions of the user role.  
3. perform database migrations.  
4. API flask server for `CRUD` in `app.py`  
5. Automated tests in `test_app.py`  
6. deploy application to heroku.  

### Technologies
- Python/Flask
- Auth0
- SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Migrate
- Flask-Cors
- Flask-Script

### Getting Started


```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ source ./setup.sh
$ python3 manage.py db init
$ python3 manage.py db migrate
```

### Running the server
To run the server, execute:
```
$ export FLASK_APP=app
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ FLASK_AP=app.py flask run
```
Setting the FLASK_ENV variable to development will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.
Setting the FLASK_APP variable to app directs flask to use the app.py file, which contains the main app methods.

### running tests

```
$ python3 test_app.py
```

### hosted heroku app
